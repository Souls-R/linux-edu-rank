    Attack of "the the"s in arch
    
    The patch below corrects multiple occurances of "the the"
    typos across several files, both in source comments and KConfig files.
    There is no actual code changed, only text.  Note this only affects the /arch
    directory, and I believe I could find many more elsewhere. :)
