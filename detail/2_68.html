    PCI: clearing wakeup flags not needed
    
    This patch (as1353) removes a couple of unnecessary assignments from
    the PCI core.  The should_wakeup flag is naturally initialized to 0;
    there's no need to clear it.

+false then reads will return an empty string, to indicate that the device
+doesn't support wakeup events.  (But even though the file appears empty, writes
+will still affect the should_wakeup flag.)

+The device_may_wakeup() routine returns true only if both flags are set.

 ------------------------------------
-All devices in the driver model have a flag to control the desired behavior of

-respectively.
-
-This setting may be adjusted by user space by writing either "on" or "auto" to
-the device's "control" file.  If "auto" is written, the device's runtime_auto
-flag will be set and the driver will be allowed to power manage the device if
-capable of doing that.  If "on" is written, the driver is not allowed to power
-manage the device which in turn is supposed to remain in the full power state at
-run time.  User space can check the current value of the runtime_auto flag by
-reading from the device's "control" file.

+
+The setting can be adjusted by user space by writing either "on" or "auto" to

+System Power Management Phases
+------------------------------
+Suspending or resuming the system is done in several phases.  Different phases
+are used for standby or memory sleep states ("suspend-to-RAM") and the

+for every device before the next phase begins.  Not all busses or classes
+support all these callbacks and not all drivers use all the callbacks.  The
+various phases always run after tasks have been frozen and before they are
+unfrozen.  Furthermore, the *_noirq phases run at a time when IRQ handlers have
+been disabled (except for those marked with the IRQ_WAKEUP flag).

+Entering System Suspend
+-----------------------
+When the system goes into the standby or memory sleep state, the phases are:
+
+		prepare, suspend, suspend_noirq.
+
+    1.	The prepare phase is meant to prevent races by preventing new devices
+	from being registered; the PM core would never know that all the
+	children of a device had been suspended if new children could be
+	registered at will.  (By contrast, devices may be unregistered at any
+	time.)  Unlike the other suspend-related phases, during the prepare
+	phase the device tree is traversed top-down.
+
+	The prepare phase uses only a bus callback.  After the callback method
+	returns, no new children may be registered below the device.  The method
+	may also prepare the device or driver in some way for the upcoming
+	system power transition, but it should not put the device into a
+	low-power state.
+
+    2.	The suspend methods should quiesce the device to stop it from performing
+	I/O.  They also may save the device registers and put it into the
+	appropriate low-power state, depending on the bus type the device is on,
+	and they may enable wakeup events.
+
+    3.	The suspend_noirq phase occurs after IRQ handlers have been disabled,
+	which means that the driver's interrupt handler will not be called while
+	the callback method is running.  The methods should save the values of
+	the device's registers that weren't saved previously and finally put the
+	device into the appropriate low-power state.
 
 	The majority of subsystems and device drivers need not implement this
-	method.  However, bus types allowing devices to share interrupt vectors,
-	like PCI, generally need to use it to prevent interrupt handling issues
-	from happening during suspend.
-
-At the end of those phases, drivers should normally have stopped all I/O
-transactions (DMA, IRQs), saved enough state that they can re-initialize
-or restore previous state (as needed by the hardware), and placed the
-device into a low-power state.  On many platforms they will also use
-gate off one or more clock sources; sometimes they will also switch off power
-supplies, or reduce voltages.  [Drivers supporting runtime PM may already have
-performed some or all of the steps needed to prepare for the upcoming system
-state transition.]

 If device_may_wakeup(dev) returns true, the device should be prepared for
-generating hardware wakeup signals when the system is in the sleep state to

+generating hardware wakeup signals to trigger a system wakeup event when the

 pci_enable_wake() does something similar for the PCI PME signal.
 
-If a driver (or subsystem) fails it suspend method, the system won't enter the
-desired low power state; it will resume all the devices it's suspended so far.
-
-
-Hibernation Phases
-------------------
-Hibernating the system is more complicated than putting it into the standby or
-memory sleep state, because it involves creating a system image and saving it.
-Therefore there are more phases of hibernation and special device PM methods are
-used in this case.
-
-First, it is necessary to prepare the system for creating a hibernation image.
-This is similar to putting the system into the standby or memory sleep state,
-although it generally doesn't require that devices be put into low power states
-(that is even not desirable at this point).  Driver notifications are then
-issued in the following order:
-
-   1	bus-&gt;pm.prepare(dev) is called after tasks have been frozen and enough
-	memory has been freed.
-
-   2	class-&gt;pm.freeze(dev) is called if implemented.  It may invoke the
-        device driver's -&gt;pm.freeze() method, unless type-&gt;pm.freeze(dev) or
-        bus-&gt;pm.freeze() does that.
-
-   3	type-&gt;pm.freeze(dev) is called if implemented.  It may invoke the device
-	driver's -&gt;pm.suspend() method, unless class-&gt;pm.freeze(dev) or
-	bus-&gt;pm.freeze() does that.
-
-   4	bus-&gt;pm.freeze(dev) is called, if implemented.  It usually calls the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.freeze() method.
-
-   5	bus-&gt;pm.freeze_noirq(dev) is called, if implemented.  It may call the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.freeze_noirq() method, depending on the bus type
-	in question.
-
-The difference between -&gt;pm.freeze() and the corresponding -&gt;pm.suspend() (and
-similarly for the "noirq" variants) is that the former should avoid preparing
-devices to trigger system wakeup events and putting devices into low power
-states, although they generally have to save the values of device registers
-so that it's possible to restore them during system resume.
-
-Second, after the system image has been created, the functionality of devices
-has to be restored so that the image can be saved.  That is similar to resuming
-devices after the system has been woken up from the standby or memory sleep
-state, which is described below, and causes the following device notifications
-to be issued:
-
-   1	bus-&gt;pm.thaw_noirq(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.thaw_noirq() method, depending on the bus type in question.
-
-   2	bus-&gt;pm.thaw(dev), if implemented; usually calls the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.thaw() method.
-
-   3	type-&gt;pm.thaw(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.thaw() method if not called by the bus type or class.
-
-   4	class-&gt;pm.thaw(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.thaw() method if not called by the bus type or device type.
-
-   5	bus-&gt;pm.complete(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.complete() method.
-
-Generally, the role of the -&gt;pm.thaw() methods (including the "noirq" variants)
-is to bring the device back to the fully functional state, so that it may be
-used for saving the image, if necessary.  The role of bus-&gt;pm.complete() is to
-reverse whatever bus-&gt;pm.prepare() did (likewise for the analogous device driver
-callbacks).
-
-After the image has been saved, the devices need to be prepared for putting the
-system into the low power state.  That is analogous to suspending them before
-putting the system into the standby or memory sleep state and involves the
-following device notifications:
-
-   1	bus-&gt;pm.prepare(dev).
-
-   2	class-&gt;pm.poweroff(dev), if implemented; may invoke the device driver's
-   	-&gt;pm.poweroff() method if not called by the bus type or device type.
-
-   3	type-&gt;pm.poweroff(dev), if implemented; may invoke the device driver's
-   	-&gt;pm.poweroff() method if not called by the bus type or device class.
-
-   4	bus-&gt;pm.poweroff(dev), if implemented; usually calls the device driver's
-   	-&gt;pm.poweroff() method (if not called by the device class or type).
-
-   5	bus-&gt;pm.poweroff_noirq(dev), if implemented; may call the device
-	driver's -&gt;pm.poweroff_noirq() method, depending on the bus type
-	in question.
-
-The difference between -&gt;pm.poweroff() and the corresponding -&gt;pm.suspend() (and
-analogously for the "noirq" variants) is that the former need not save the
-device's registers.  Still, they should prepare the device for triggering
-system wakeup events if necessary and finally put it into the appropriate low
-power state.
-
-
-Device Low Power (suspend) States
----------------------------------
-Device low-power states aren't standard.  One device might only handle
-"on" and "off, while another might support a dozen different versions of
-"on" (how many engines are active?), plus a state that gets back to "on"
-faster than from a full "off".
-
-Some busses define rules about what different suspend states mean.  PCI
-gives one example:  after the suspend sequence completes, a non-legacy
-PCI device may not perform DMA or issue IRQs, and any wakeup events it
-issues would be issued through the PME# bus signal.  Plus, there are
-several PCI-standard device states, some of which are optional.
-
-In contrast, integrated system-on-chip processors often use IRQs as the
-wakeup event sources (so drivers would call enable_irq_wake) and might
-be able to treat DMA completion as a wakeup event (sometimes DMA can stay
-active too, it'd only be the CPU and some peripherals that sleep).
-
-Some details here may be platform-specific.  Systems may have devices that
-can be fully active in certain sleep states, such as an LCD display that's
-refreshed using DMA while most of the system is sleeping lightly ... and
-its frame buffer might even be updated by a DSP or other non-Linux CPU while
-the Linux control processor stays idle.
-
-Moreover, the specific actions taken may depend on the target system state.
-One target system state might allow a given device to be very operational;
-another might require a hard shut down with re-initialization on resume.
-And two different target systems might use the same device in different
-ways; the aforementioned LCD might be active in one product's "standby",
-but a different product using the same SOC might work differently.
+If any of these callbacks returns an error, the system won't enter the desired
+low-power state.  Instead the PM core will unwind its actions by resuming all
+the devices that were suspended.
 
 
-Resuming Devices
-----------------
-Resuming is done in multiple phases, much like suspending, with all
-devices processing each phase's calls before the next phase begins.
+Leaving System Suspend
+----------------------
+When resuming from standby or memory sleep, the phases are:
 
-Again, however, different callbacks are used depending on whether the system is
-waking up from the standby or memory sleep state ("suspend-to-RAM") or from
-hibernation ("suspend-to-disk").
+		resume_noirq, resume, complete.
 
-If the system is waking up from the standby or memory sleep state, the phases
-are seen by driver notifications issued in this order:
-
-   1	bus-&gt;pm.resume_noirq(dev) is called, if implemented.  It may call the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.resume_noirq() method, depending on the bus type in
-	question.
-
-	The role of this method is to perform actions that need to be performed
-	before device drivers' interrupt handlers are allowed to be invoked.  If
-	the given bus type permits devices to share interrupt vectors, like PCI,
-	this method should bring the device and its driver into a state in which
-	the driver can recognize if the device is the source of incoming
-	interrupts, if any, and handle them correctly.
+    1.	The resume_noirq callback methods should perform any actions needed
+	before the driver's interrupt handlers are invoked.  This generally
+	means undoing the actions of the suspend_noirq phase.  If the bus type
+	permits devices to share interrupt vectors, like PCI, the method should
+	bring the device and its driver into a state in which the driver can
+	recognize if the device is the source of incoming interrupts, if any,
+	and handle them correctly.
 
 	For example, the PCI bus type's -&gt;pm.resume_noirq() puts the device into
-	the full power state (D0 in the PCI terminology) and restores the
-	standard configuration registers of the device.  Then, it calls the
+	the full-power state (D0 in the PCI terminology) and restores the
+	standard configuration registers of the device.  Then it calls the
 	device driver's -&gt;pm.resume_noirq() method to perform device-specific
-	actions needed at this stage of resume.
-
-   2	bus-&gt;pm.resume(dev) is called, if implemented.  It usually calls the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.resume() method.
-
-	This call should generally bring the the device back to the working
-	state, so that it can do I/O as requested after the call has returned.
-	However, it may be more convenient to use the device class or device
-	type -&gt;pm.resume() for this purpose, in which case the bus type's
-	-&gt;pm.resume() method need not be implemented at all.
-
-   3	type-&gt;pm.resume(dev) is called, if implemented.  It may invoke the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.resume() method, unless class-&gt;pm.resume(dev) or
-	bus-&gt;pm.resume() does that.
-
-	For devices that are not associated with any bus type or device class
-	this method plays the role of bus-&gt;pm.resume().
-
-   4	class-&gt;pm.resume(dev) is called, if implemented.  It may invoke the
-	device driver's -&gt;pm.resume() method, unless bus-&gt;pm.resume(dev) or
-	type-&gt;pm.resume() does that.
-
-	For devices that are not associated with any bus type or device type
-	this method plays the role of bus-&gt;pm.resume().
+	actions.
 
-   5	bus-&gt;pm.complete(dev) is called, if implemented.  It is supposed to
-	invoke the device driver's -&gt;pm.complete() method.
+    2.	The resume methods should bring the the device back to its operating
+	state, so that it can perform normal I/O.  This generally involves
+	undoing the actions of the suspend phase.
 
-	The role of this method is to reverse whatever bus-&gt;pm.prepare(dev)
-	(or the driver's -&gt;pm.prepare()) did during suspend, if necessary.
+    3.	The complete phase uses only a bus callback.  The method should undo the
+	actions of the prepare phase.  Note, however, that new children may be
+	registered below the device as soon as the resume callbacks occur; it's
+	not necessary to wait until the complete phase.
 
-At the end of those phases, drivers should normally be as functional as
-they were before suspending:  I/O can be performed using DMA and IRQs, and
-the relevant clocks are gated on.  In principle the device need not be
-"fully on"; it might be in a runtime lowpower/suspend state during suspend and
-the resume callbacks may try to restore that state, but that need not be
-desirable from the user's point of view.  In fact, there are multiple reasons
-why it's better to always put devices into the "fully working" state in the
-system sleep resume callbacks and they are discussed in more detail in
-Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt.
+At the end of these phases, drivers should be as functional as they were before

+full-power state.  There are multiple reasons why it's best to do this; they are

-Resume From Hibernation
------------------------
+
+Entering Hibernation
+--------------------
+Hibernating the system is more complicated than putting it into the standby or
+memory sleep state, because it involves creating and saving a system image.
+Therefore there are more phases for hibernation, with a different set of
+callbacks.  These phases always run after tasks have been frozen and memory has
+been freed.
+
+The general procedure for hibernation is to quiesce all devices (freeze), create
+an image of the system memory while everything is stable, reactivate all
+devices (thaw), write the image to permanent storage, and finally shut down the
+system (poweroff).  The phases used to accomplish this are:
+
+	prepare, freeze, freeze_noirq, thaw_noirq, thaw, complete,
+	prepare, poweroff, poweroff_noirq
+
+    1.	The prepare phase is discussed in the "Entering System Suspend" section
+	above.
+
+    2.	The freeze methods should quiesce the device so that it doesn't generate
+	IRQs or DMA, and they may need to save the values of device registers.
+	However the device does not have to be put in a low-power state, and to
+	save time it's best not to do so.  Also, the device should not be
+	prepared to generate wakeup events.
+
+    3.	The freeze_noirq phase is analogous to the suspend_noirq phase discussed
+	above, except again that the device should not be put in a low-power
+	state and should not be allowed to generate wakeup events.
+
+At this point the system image is created.  All devices should be inactive and
+the contents of memory should remain undisturbed while this happens, so that the
+image forms an atomic snapshot of the system state.
+
+    4.	The thaw_noirq phase is analogous to the resume_noirq phase discussed
+	above.  The main difference is that its methods can assume the device is
+	in the same state as at the end of the freeze_noirq phase.
+
+    5.	The thaw phase is analogous to the resume phase discussed above.  Its
+	methods should bring the device back to an operating state, so that it
+	can be used for saving the image if necessary.
+
+    6.	The complete phase is discussed in the "Leaving System Suspend" section
+	above.
+
+At this point the system image is saved, and the devices then need to be
+prepared for the upcoming system shutdown.  This is much like suspending them
+before putting the system into the standby or memory sleep state, and the phases
+are similar.
+
+    7.	The prepare phase is discussed above.
+
+    8.	The poweroff phase is analogous to the suspend phase.
+
+    9.	The poweroff_noirq phase is analogous to the suspend_noirq phase.
+
+The poweroff and poweroff_noirq callbacks should do essentially the same things
+as the suspend and suspend_noirq callbacks.  The only notable difference is that
+they need not store the device register values, because the registers should
+already have been stored during the freeze or freeze_noirq phases.
+
+
+Leaving Hibernation
+-------------------
 Resuming from hibernation is, again, more complicated than resuming from a sleep
 state in which the contents of main memory are preserved, because it requires
 a system image to be loaded into memory and the pre-hibernation memory contents
 to be restored before control can be passed back to the image kernel.
 
-In principle, the image might be loaded into memory and the pre-hibernation
-memory contents might be restored by the boot loader.  For this purpose,
-however, the boot loader would need to know the image kernel's entry point and
-there's no protocol defined for passing that information to boot loaders.  As
-a workaround, the boot loader loads a fresh instance of the kernel, called the
-boot kernel, into memory and passes control to it in a usual way.  Then, the
-boot kernel reads the hibernation image, restores the pre-hibernation memory
-contents and passes control to the image kernel.  Thus, in fact, two different
-kernels are involved in resuming from hibernation and in general they are not
-only different because they play different roles in this operation.  Actually,
-the boot kernel may be completely different from the image kernel.  Not only
-the configuration of it, but also the version of it may be different.
-The consequences of this are important to device drivers and their subsystems
-(bus types, device classes and device types) too.
-
-Namely, to be able to load the hibernation image into memory, the boot kernel
-needs to include at least the subset of device drivers allowing it to access the
-storage medium containing the image, although it generally doesn't need to
-include all of the drivers included into the image kernel.  After the image has
-been loaded the devices handled by those drivers need to be prepared for passing
-control back to the image kernel.  This is very similar to the preparation of
-devices for creating a hibernation image described above.  In fact, it is done
-in the same way, with the help of the -&gt;pm.prepare(), -&gt;pm.freeze() and
--&gt;pm.freeze_noirq() callbacks, but only for device drivers included in the boot
-kernel (whose versions may generally be different from the versions of the
-analogous drivers from the image kernel).
+Although in principle, the image might be loaded into memory and the
+pre-hibernation memory contents restored by the boot loader, in practice this
+can't be done because boot loaders aren't smart enough and there is no
+established protocol for passing the necessary information.  So instead, the
+boot loader loads a fresh instance of the kernel, called the boot kernel, into
+memory and passes control to it in the usual way.  Then the boot kernel reads
+the system image, restores the pre-hibernation memory contents, and passes
+control to the image kernel.  Thus two different kernels are involved in
+resuming from hibernation.  In fact, the boot kernel may be completely different
+from the image kernel: a different configuration and even a different version.
+This has important consequences for device drivers and their subsystems.
+
+To be able to load the system image into memory, the boot kernel needs to
+include at least a subset of device drivers allowing it to access the storage
+medium containing the image, although it doesn't need to include all of the
+drivers present in the image kernel.  After the image has been loaded, the
+devices managed by the boot kernel need to be prepared for passing control back
+to the image kernel.  This is very similar to the initial steps involved in
+creating a system image, and it is accomplished in the same way, using prepare,
+freeze, and freeze_noirq phases.  However the devices affected by these phases
+are only those having drivers in the boot kernel; other devices will still be in
+whatever state the boot loader left them.
 
 Should the restoration of the pre-hibernation memory contents fail, the boot
-kernel would carry out the procedure of "thawing" devices described above, using
-the -&gt;pm.thaw_noirq(), -&gt;pm.thaw(), and -&gt;pm.complete() callbacks provided by
-subsystems and device drivers.  This, however, is a very rare condition.  Most
-often the pre-hibernation memory contents are restored successfully and control
-is passed to the image kernel that is now responsible for bringing the system
-back to the working state.

+thaw_noirq, thaw, and complete phases, and then continue running normally.  This
+happens only rarely.  Most often the pre-hibernation memory contents are
+restored successfully and control is passed to the image kernel, which then
+becomes responsible for bringing the system back to the working state.
 
-To achieve this goal, among other things, the image kernel restores the
-pre-hibernation functionality of devices.  This operation is analogous to the
-resuming of devices after waking up from the memory sleep state, although it
-involves different device notifications which are the following:
+To achieve this, the image kernel must restore the devices' pre-hibernation
+functionality.  The operation is much like waking up from the memory sleep
+state, although it involves different phases:
 
-   1	bus-&gt;pm.restore_noirq(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.restore_noirq() method, depending on the bus type in question.
+	restore_noirq, restore, complete
 
-   2	bus-&gt;pm.restore(dev), if implemented; usually calls the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.restore() method.
+    1.	The restore_noirq phase is analogous to the resume_noirq phase.
 
-   3	type-&gt;pm.restore(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.restore() method if not called by the bus type or class.
+    2.	The restore phase is analogous to the resume phase.
 
-   4	class-&gt;pm.restore(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.restore() method if not called by the bus type or device type.
+    3.	The complete phase is discussed above.
 
-   5	bus-&gt;pm.complete(dev), if implemented; may call the device driver's
-	-&gt;pm.complete() method.
-
-The roles of the -&gt;pm.restore_noirq() and -&gt;pm.restore() callbacks are analogous
-to the roles of the corresponding resume callbacks, but they must assume that
-the device may have been accessed before by the boot kernel.  Consequently, the
-state of the device before they are called may be different from the state of it
-right prior to calling the resume callbacks.  That difference usually doesn't
-matter, so the majority of device drivers can set their resume and restore
-callback pointers to the same routine.  Nevertheless, different callback
-pointers are used in case there is a situation where it actually matters.
+The main difference from resume[_noirq] is that restore[_noirq] must assume the
+device has been accessed and reconfigured by the boot loader or the boot kernel.
+Consequently the state of the device may be different from the state remembered
+from the freeze and freeze_noirq phases.  The device may even need to be reset
+and completely re-initialized.  In many cases this difference doesn't matter, so
+the resume[_noirq] and restore[_norq] method pointers can be set to the same
+routines.  Nevertheless, different callback pointers are used in case there is a
+situation where it actually matters.

+Device Low Power (suspend) States
+---------------------------------
+Device low-power states aren't standard.  One device might only handle
+"on" and "off, while another might support a dozen different versions of
+"on" (how many engines are active?), plus a state that gets back to "on"
+faster than from a full "off".
+
+Some busses define rules about what different suspend states mean.  PCI
+gives one example:  after the suspend sequence completes, a non-legacy
+PCI device may not perform DMA or issue IRQs, and any wakeup events it
+issues would be issued through the PME# bus signal.  Plus, there are
+several PCI-standard device states, some of which are optional.
+
+In contrast, integrated system-on-chip processors often use IRQs as the
+wakeup event sources (so drivers would call enable_irq_wake) and might
+be able to treat DMA completion as a wakeup event (sometimes DMA can stay
+active too, it'd only be the CPU and some peripherals that sleep).
+
+Some details here may be platform-specific.  Systems may have devices that
+can be fully active in certain sleep states, such as an LCD display that's
+refreshed using DMA while most of the system is sleeping lightly ... and
+its frame buffer might even be updated by a DSP or other non-Linux CPU while
+the Linux control processor stays idle.
+
+Moreover, the specific actions taken may depend on the target system state.
+One target system state might allow a given device to be very operational;
+another might require a hard shut down with re-initialization on resume.
+And two different target systems might use the same device in different
+ways; the aforementioned LCD might be active in one product's "standby",
+but a different product using the same SOC might work differently.

    PM: Allow runtime_suspend methods to call pm_schedule_suspend()
    
    This patch (as1361) changes the runtime PM interface slightly; it
    allows suspend requests to be scheduled while the runtime_suspend
    method is running.  If the method succeeds then the scheduled request
    is cancelled, whereas if the method fails then an idle notification is
    sent only if no request was scheduled.
    
    Being able to schedule suspend requests from within a runtime_suspend
    method is useful for drivers that need to test for idleness and
    suspend the device all while holding a single spinlock, or for drivers
    that want to check for idleness by polling.

    USB: put claimed interfaces in the "suspended" state
    
    This patch (as1370) fixes a bug in the USB runtime power management
    code.  When a driver claims an interface, it doesn't expect to need to
    call usb_autopm_get_interface() or usb_autopm_put_interface() for
    runtime PM to work.  Runtime PM can be controlled by the driver's
    primary interface; the additional interfaces it claims shouldn't
    interfere.  As things stand, the claimed interfaces will prevent the
    device from autosuspending.
    
    To fix this problem, the patch sets interfaces to the suspended state
    when they are claimed.
    
    Also, although in theory this shouldn't matter, the patch changes the
    suspend code so that interfaces are suspended in reverse order from
    detection and resuming.  This is how the PM core works, and we ought
    to use the same approach.

    USB: fix remote wakeup settings during system sleep
    
    This patch (as1363) changes the way USB remote wakeup is handled
    during system sleeps.  It won't be enabled unless an interface driver
    specifically needs it.  Also, it won't be enabled during the FREEZE or
    QUIESCE phases of hibernation, when the system doesn't respond to
    wakeup events anyway.  Finally, if the device is already
    runtime-suspended with remote wakeup enabled, but wakeup is supposed
    to be disabled for the system sleep, the device gets woken up so that
    it can be suspended again with the proper wakeup setting.
    
    This will fix problems people have reported with certain USB webcams
    that generate wakeup requests when they shouldn't, and as a result
    cause system suspends to fail.  See
