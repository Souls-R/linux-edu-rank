    docs: admin-guide: Update bootloader and installation instructions
    
    Updates the bootloader and installation instructions in
    admin-guide/README.rst to align with modern practices.
    
    Details of Changes:
    
     - Added guidance on using EFISTUB for UEFI/EFI systems.
     - Noted that LILO is no longer in active development and provides
       alternatives.
     - Kept LILO instructions but marked as Legacy LILO Instructions.
       Suggest removal in future patch.

+   For more details on EFISTUB,

+   active development, though as it was extremely popular, it often comes up
+   in documentation. Popular alternatives include GRUB2, rEFInd, Syslinux,
+   systemd-boot, or EFISTUB. For various reasons, it's not recommended to use
+   software that's no longer in active development.

    Resolves Sphinx unexpected indentation warning when compiling
    documentation (e.g. `make htmldocs`). Replaces tabs with spaces and adds
    a literal block to keep vertical formatting of the
    example power state list.
